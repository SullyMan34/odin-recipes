Project: Recipes

Created a repository on GitHub, then cloned it with the SSH into the repos folder
I'll definitely need to get comfortable as to when I neeed to do git add + git commit cycles and will probably still hyper-reference until I am.

Outline of this project is going to created a main page, create a recipe page for relative referencing, adding some content to practice basic HTML commands.
